This MP3 player has been made as a small learning project.
Simply run the python file to check it out.

Currently the player uses the following python modules:  1. Os(for loading files)
                                                         2. Tkinter(for GUI) 
                                                         3. Pygame(for playing audio)

I will be adding more features as I learn more :)
